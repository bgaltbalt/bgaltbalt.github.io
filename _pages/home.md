I am an ecologist, interested in animal movement, migration and population dynamics. Using
the field observations, movement tracking, and large ecological datasets, I study mechanisms 
driving population change.

Currently I lead the Connectivity and Climate Change team at [WCS Mongolia](https://mongolia.wcs.org/en-us/About-Us.aspx), where we conduct
research and conservation to understand and mitigate impacts of habitat fragmentation and climate extremes on wildlife populations.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Cornell Lab of Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/batbayar-galtbalt/), where I studied the macro-demography 
of North American birds using eBird citizen science dataset and climatic models. 

During my PhD in Australia, I investigated how weather and climate change influence 
long-distance avian migrants. My research explored how birds select their flight altitudes and 
migration routes under varying atmospheric conditions and on-ground conditions, as well as the drivers of population decline in White-naped crane.
